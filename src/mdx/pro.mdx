  # hello, i'm sean.
  ## i'm a developer and i really freaking like to code.

<div data-inline>
i've been obsessed with computers for years, getting my first little toshiba
netbook around 2010. i started programming in high school and found a
particular passion for web development.

<div data-canvas>
<Canvas fileName="dood_no_sway.glb" order={0} sceneName="dood_at_desk" />
i specialize in node.js and frameworks like next.js and meteor with extensive
experience in javascript/typescript, css/scss and, less obsessively, c++ and
lua. i'm trying to always be learning something, and i've got my future
sights on game development and embedded programming.

  i live in a bunker 2000 miles under the ocean (my house) with this small
  orange thing (cat) named merlin. as merlin grows, so does his malicious intent.
  he may end up killing me and taking my place one day. there will be no way to
  tell.
  <Canvas
